***About Website***




***Header***

Hovering the mouse over each of the navigation links with change the color of the text from whitesmoke to clue and the mouse will turn into a pointer.

As the screen size gets smaller, the navigation links begin to wrap and then at the 500px max breaking point, the navigation links will collapse into a hamburger menu and the logo will center over the "contact" button at the bottom of the header. The navigation links will reappear once the user selects the hamburger menu icon. At the min width of 768px and 700px (orientation: landscape), the navigation links will be in a single column.  

At the max width break point of 500px, the navigation links will be hidden in a hamburger menu. If the user clicks on the three lines, the navigation links 
will re-appear. 

*Note, these same features are repeated across all pages
